# Shopping cart and api examples in Cypress

## Notes

1. Please run the api tests multiple times. The new version of Cypress is very fast and since the website is very slow, sometimes the tests fail. But all of them are passed and work as intended.
2. The custom scrips for running the tests can be found in **package.json** file
3. Also, the custom script for generating reports is found in **package.json** file and the results are found in **results** folder
4. Dependencies needed for running the tests: you should have a package manager yarn/npm
5. Before running the tests do: yarn/npm i -> this will install cypress and prettier for ui (note : prettier is just for formatting the code)
